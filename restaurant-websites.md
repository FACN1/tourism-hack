# Restaurant Websites

### Local restaurants
- Create websites for local restaurants?
- Have a single website, with pages for each restaurant - maybe Nazareth library. Business owners could login with OAuth possibly, and update info, possibly with a markdown GUI editor and compiler.
- Could be updated via APIs (say have a simple PHP, Node, etc, REST API that links to a markdown file on business's websites)
