# Glass Recycling

For those who don't know, the bottle deposit law in Israel regulates a deposit, refund and recycling system. One issue for tourists or non-locals is its not easy to find out where glass bottles can be recycled. A few stores say they will recycle the bottles for you, but won't always give the refund back.

Solutions:

- A simple map of places where people could go to recycle glass bottles would be of great help.

- If local wine / alcohol stores around Nazareth were open to receiving 'donated' bottles for recycling (as in, not with the expectation of a refund), this could be better publicised either on their own sites (if they have one), added to google maps, or on a central official glass recycling guide.

- From reading various sources, it seems there's a consensus that the deposit charged on each bottle isn't really worth the effort to recycle the bottle, however there are homeless people who collect bottles so they can earn some money by returning them to the banks and keeping the deposit refund. Its a bit of a stretch-goal, but if local stores were willing to donate glass bottles to locals, some homeless charities / recycling organisations/
