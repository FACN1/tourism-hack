# Mary's Well Restaurant Coop
### m4v15 and Philawsophizing

There are a lot of restaurants/bars in Mary's well square, however most are lacking an online presence and an online search returns few results.

We believe there's an opportunity to boost the image/business if the square is treated as a cohesive area rather than targeting one business at a time for a new website.

The vision would be to have a square which is a gathering place similar to other squares in city's with rich history's (Venice, Barcelona, Paris, Istanbul).

Reasons to do it:
- Make Nazareth a cultural (food/goods/lodgings/entertainment) destination, in addition to a religious destination
- Boost the online presence for Nazareth with a cohesive and curated approach (Brand)

What will it look like:
- Show business hours
- Allow for reservations
- Upcoming events
- Popular times
- Interactive map
- Restaurant highlighting could rotate (no favoritism)
- Link to reviews/allow reviews that link through to multiple sites (auto-post to tripAdvisor, Facebook, Google)
