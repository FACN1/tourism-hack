# Restaurant Websites

### Local restaurants
- Create websites for local restaurants?
- Have a single website, with pages for each restaurant - maybe Nazareth library. Business owners could login with OAuth possibly, and update info, possibly with a markdown GUI editor and compiler.
- Could be updated via APIs (say have a simple PHP, Node, etc, REST API that links to a markdown file on business's websites)



## Hub Website for Restaurants

- Business categories
- Reviews
- Focus on good quality food
- [TripAdvisor API](https://developer-tripadvisor.com/content-api/)

**List of Information User Might Want**
- Name
- Type of Food / Categories
- Pricing
- Location
- Reviews


**User Experience**
- I would like to see of all restaurants filtered by category.
- I would like clear, easy to read information on the restaurant.
- I would like to find pricing of the restaurant.
- I would like to find useful, insightful reviews of the restaurant.



**What a User Gets From the Website**
- Events (Arabic/cultural/music/festivals)
- Discounts - stay for longer

**What a Business/Restaurant Owner Gets From the Hub/Directory**
- Attract more people to eat there.
- More loyal customers - encourage people who are staying for a longer period of time to eat there.
